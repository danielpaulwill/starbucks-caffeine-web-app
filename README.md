Starbucks Caffeine Web App

DESCRIPTION
My first child was born about two months ago. Luckily, I'm an avid lover of coffee. Over the last two months my coffee consumption has skyrocketed. I tried energy drinks, I tried soda, I tried tea but coffee is really the only liquid substance I keep coming back to that is both delicious and satisfies my desire to not fall asleep while holding my newborn.

I still make my own coffee using various methods when I have the time, but what was once a joy has become a chore. A means to an end. Thankfully there are a variety of prepackaged coffee drinks ripe for the taking in every grocery store I find myself wandering into. I've tried many different kinds, but Starbucks seems to meet that sweet spot between quality and price. The tough thing with coffee however, is that the caffeine content is almost never available. It's not put on the cans or the packaging itself, and it's not readily available on grocer's websites.

I wanted to create an app that had this caffeine content information front and center so I could quickly compare drinks and choose one accordingly. The other two main data points I cared most about was sugar content (I try to limit how much I intake) and serving size (I need to know how quickly I can down these drinks). So I created the Starbucks Caffeine Web App.

FEATURES
- Photo showing each drink
- Serving size, caffeine and sugar content data
- Filterable by drink type
- Favorting ability to quickly return to your favorite drinks.

INSTALLATION
After downloading the package, you'll need to run a JSON server in your terminal to access the database. If you've run a JSON server before, skip to step B.

STEPS
A. Enter "npm install -g json-server" in the terminal.
B. Enter "json-server --watch db.json" in the terminal.

That should get your JSON server up and running.
